# camel-kafka2db

This project is a simple integration from Kafka to a PostgreSQL DB using Apache Camel for integration.


The Camel Kafka component connects and listens on a Kafka topic, retrieves data, and inserts it into a database.

In order to run the project, you need an instance of Apache Kafka as well as an installation of PostgreSQL on the local machine
